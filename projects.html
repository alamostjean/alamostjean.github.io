    <h2>Lefty</h2>
	<p>The whole game is played using a controller with all the controls mapped to the left side of the controller, forcing the player to adapt to succeed by playing with only the left hand.</p>
    <p>The game is also designed by switching around common concepts of sidescrollers: Lefty can move from left to right, but levels are designed with the most challenging parts going from right to left, while going from left to right are reserved for more calm moments. Each level is also oriented backwards from common platformers, Lefty always begins a level on the right side and must navigate it to find the exit on the left side. The overall goal is to disorient the player and make him feel vulnerable while experiencing what being a newly forced left-handed person feels like.</p>
	<p>Lastly, "Lefty" is inspired by my childhood love of the 16-bit era. The game's aesthetic is curated to emulate the look and feel of a long lost Sega Genesis game or at least a distorted memory of what it was like playing on a CRT television screen.</p>

    <p>Corporate Ladder Inc. is a light-hearted puzzle platformer created for the Winter Game Jam 2025 at Lasalle College. It tied for first-place for best game made by students. The whole game was created in just under 5 weeks.</p>
	<p>I've had the privilege of being the Lead Game Designer and the Lead Narrative Designer for this project. Early on we've established the general concept and decided to use humor to convey the tone of the whole game.</p>
	<p>For this project, I've established the general concept along with the Lead Level Designer, from then we've established the whole flow of the game along with the different mechanics encountered throughout the levels.</p>

    <h2>Boomer Fragfest</h2>
    <p>This project was a simple exercise in my Game Design class where our teacher sent us a project to use with game variables and settings all wrong.</p>
	<p>We've had to figure out on our own what to change and adjust to make the game "feel good". As a fan of Old School FPS of the 90's, I went for a Quake vibe.</p>
	<p>I've also decided to integrate my game and my level design skills for this demo, using the environment and audio voice over to guide the player in the environment as well as giving subtle cues of what dangers lie in the world.</p>

    <h2>Echoes of the Temple</h2>
    <p>For this project, I was the lead game designer. I elaborated the overall game design, created the Game Design Document and programmed the main 3Cs and two of the main mechanics.</p>
	<p>In order to achieve that goal, we decided early on to ground our game in reality for movements and world interaction and add the mystic in the design of the three core mechanics of the Masks used by the player</p>
	<p>to overcome the different puzzles thrown his way. A strong visual identity was also adopted early on the differentiate the three core mechanics of the masks and the abilities they gave to the player.</p>
