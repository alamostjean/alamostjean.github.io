      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Alamo — a passionate and creative game designer. I've been playing games and wondering how they were made ever since I first played Mario Bros. on the NES in the late 80's. I've had a long career in marketing where I worked on multiple projects with passionate people but coming around my late thirties I decided to change my path and truly embrace my true passion: video games! 
      </p>

      <p>
        I've got a knack for detail, communicating ideas and presenting strong and bold designs and laying out the ground work for projects. I especially love retro style games but I'm at ease using Unreal Engine 5 to design and deliver amazing looking games that are well optimized and can both be played on PC using mouse and keyboard as well as designing for controllers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of game design, I am also a generalist who simply excels at learning constantly and applying newly acquired skills to my work!

		I love playing old retro games of my youth over and over again as well as playing the latest hit and analyzing the ins and outs of those games made by my peers to challenge myself in perfecting the art of game design and innovate, game after game!
